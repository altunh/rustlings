These are my solutions to the 95 exercises in the Rustlings course.
Refer to the [rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) repository.

## Verifying Exercises

Clone repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/altunh/rustlings
cd rustlings
cargo install --force --path .
```

If there are installation errors, ensure that your toolchain is up to date. For the latest, run:

```bash
rustup update
```

This will try to verify the completion of every exercise in a predetermined order:

```bash
rustlings verify
```
